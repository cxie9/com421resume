My index page shows my resume styled with css. The heading contains a link to a PDF copy of my resume. In my headers, I have a meta tag so that my site is mobile-friendly as well. I have my major headings (i.e., Education, Experience, etc.), subheadings (i.e., job positions, school names), and paragraph tags follow a common styling. At the bottom of the page I have a link for users to click if they want to know about more of my projects. This directs them to my projects page that contains live examples of my work instead of only having them listed under projects.

My projects page holds iframes of my current projects, styled with the same CSS theme as my resume/index site. The headings also act as links to full-page sites of my projects in case the iframes don’t work or for screen reader alternatives. If I had more time, I would like to work more on my personal web folio site. Right now, I only have it redirecting to a wix site I made even though I paid for the domain cindoodles.com. In the future I’d like my domain to showcase my personal web design work not from a template.
